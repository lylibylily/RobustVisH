# RobustVisH
Our paper **"RobustVisH: Robust Visual-Haptic Cross-Modal Recognition Under Transmission Interference"** has been accepted by ACM MM 2025! This GitHub repo is the home for supplementary materials related to it. The paper proposes a Robust Visual-Haptic recognition (RobustVisH) model that identifies Low-Quality (LQ) visual-haptic data with transmission distortion for the first time. The full code and all the experimental details will be uploaded to this repository once the paper is officially published in the ACM MM 2025 conference proceedings, following ACM's rules.
